1.  THIS PROGRAM PERFORMS FURTHER TESTS ON THE FLUB MACROS.  IT SHOULD
2.  BE RUN ONLY AFTER FLT1 HAS BEEN COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY.  OUTPUT 
3.  FROM THIS PROGRAM CONSISTS OF A SERIES OF NUMBERED LINES AND ERROR
4.  MESSAGES.  BOTH REGISTER AND MEMORY OPERATIONS ARE TESTED HERE. 
1.  THIS LINE SHOULD APPEAR ONLY ON CHANNEL 3 (MACHINE READABLE OUTPUT) 
5.  CONV ERROR MESSAGE SHOULD FOLLOW
6.  EXPR ERROR MESSAGE SHOULD FOLLOW
7.  FULL ERROR MESSAGE SHOULD FOLLOW
8.  IOCH ERROR MESSAGE SHOULD FOLLOW
     MESSAGE ALTERS VAL FIELD OF CHANNEL REGISTER.

     MESSAGE DOES NOT ALTER THE FLAG OF THE CHANNEL REGISTER. 
     MESSAGE DESTROYS THE FLAG OF THE CHANNEL REGISTER. 
     FLG * = * FAILS FOR BOTH DESCRIPTORS ALPHABETIC. 
     VAL X = X + * FAILS
     VAL X = * + X FAILS
     VAL X = X - * FAILS
     VAL X = * - X FAILS
     PTR X = X + * FAILS
     PTR X = * + X FAILS 
     PTR X = X - * FAILS
     PTR X = * - X FAILS
     PTR X = X * * FAILS 
     PTR X = * * X FAILS 
     PTR X = X / * FAILS
     PTR X = * / X FAILS
     VAL X = X + X FAILS 
     VAL X = X - X FAILS 
     PTR X = X + X FAILS 
     PTR X = X - X  FAILS
     PTR X = X * X FAILS 
     PTR X = X / X FAILS 
9.  REGISTER TESTS COMPLETE.  I/O TESTS FOLLOW. 
     VAL * = CHAR  ALTERS FLG OR PTR.
10. IF THIS REPEATS, -1 DIDNT CLEAR LINE BUFFER. A BLANK SHOULD FOLLOW. 
11. THIS LINE SHOULD BE SEPARATED FROM 10 BY A BLANK LINE.
     WRITE NEXT ALTERS VAL FIELD OF SPECIFYING REGISTER.
     WRITE NEXT ALTERS PTR FIELD OF SPECIFYING REGISTER.
     WRITE NEXT SETS ENDFILE ON CHANNEL 4.
     WRITE NEXT SETS ILLEGAL OPERATION ON CHANNEL 4.
     WRITE NEXT DOES NOT ALTER FLAG OF SPECIFYING REGISTER. 
     WRITE NEXT DESTROYS FLAG OF SPECIFYING REGISTER. 
     READ NEXT ALTERS VAL FIELD OF SPECIFYING REGISTER. 
     READ NEXT ALTERS PTR FIELD OF SPECIFYING REGISTER. 
     READ NEXT SETS ENDFILE ON CHANNEL 1. 
     READ NEXT SETS ILLEGAL OPERATION ON CHANNEL 1. 
     READ NEXT DOES NOT ALTER FLAG OF SPECIFYING REGISTER.
     READ NEXT DESTROYS FLAG OF SPECIFYING REGISTER.
     REWIND ALTERS VAL FIELD OF SPECIFYING REGISTER.
     REWIND ALTERS PTR FIELD OF SPECIFYING REGISTER.
     REWIND SET ENDFILE ON CHANNEL 2. 
     REWIND SET ILLEGAL OPERATION ON CHANNEL 2. 
     REWIND DOES NOT ALTER FLAG OF SPECIFYING REGISTER. 
     REWIND DESTROYS FLAG OF SPECIFYING REGISTER. 
12. THIS LINE WAS WRITTEN TO CHANNEL 2 AND READ BACK. 
13. THIS LINE WAS ALSO READ BACK FROM CHANNEL 2.  IT WAS THE LAST.
     THE LINE BUFFER WAS UNCHANGED BY A READ FROM CHANNEL 2.
     REWIND DOES NOT REPOSITION CHANNEL 2 PROPERLY. 
     NO ENDFILE FOUND ON CHANNEL 2. 
2.  THIS LINE SHOULD ONLY APPEAR ON CHANNEL 3 
3.  THIS LINE SHOULD ONLY APPEAR ON CHANNEL 3 (IT IS THE LAST)
14. I/O TESTS COMPLETE.  MEMORY TESTS FOLLOW. 
     MEMORY SIZE IS ZERO OR NEGATIVE, FURTHER TESTS ABORTED
     ERROR IN STO-GET IN FLG FIELD. 
     ERROR IN STO-GET IN VAL FIELD. 
     ERROR IN STO-GET IN PTR FIELD. 
15. MEMORY TESTS COMPLETE.  FURTHER TESTS OF CHARACTER I/O FOLLOW.
16. IF LINE 17 IS WRONG, -1 WAS NOT FOUND AT THE END OF THE LINE BUFFER.
17. 000 CHARACTERS WERE EXTRACTED FROM THIS LINE BEFORE FINDING -1. 
18. THE NEXT LINE TESTS THE SETTING OF FLG=1 ON FILLING THE LINE BUFFER.
     FLG IS NOT SET TO 0 WHEN A SPACE IS INSERTED INTO THE LINE BUFFER
     FLG IS NOT SET TO 1 WHEN -1 IS INSERTED INTO THE LINE BUFFER 
19. A FULL LINE OF DOTS PROVES THE FLG IS SET PROPERLY BY CHAR = VAL *.
