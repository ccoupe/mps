This directory contains a simple Unix implementation of STAGE2.  It is
identical to the implementation discussed in Appendix A of "Implementing
Software for Non-Numeric Applications", except that the implementation
language is C instead of FORTRAN.

To create an executable version, give the command "make".  After the
executable version has been created, superfluous files can be removed by
giving the command "make tidy".  The directory can be returned to its
original state by giving the command "make clean".

The STAGE2 implementation provides four I/O units:

	1	Standard input
	2	File "scratch" in the local directory
	3	File "code" in the local directory
	4	Standard output

A typical application using a macro file "macros" to convert a text file
"text" would use the command:

	cat macros text | stage2

After completion of the command the translated text would appear in file
"code" and any error messages would have been written to standard output.
