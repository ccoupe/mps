C  THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO MAINTAIN A LIBRARY TAPE FOR THE    FIMP0001
C  MOBILE PROGRAMMING SYSTEM.  IT IS A SIMPLE FILE UTILITY WHICH        FIMP0002
C  MANIPULATES 80-COLUMN CARDS SERIALIZED IN COLUMNS 73-80.  THERE ARE  FIMP0003
C  EIGHT COMMANDS (BELOW) SPECIFIED BY A SINGLE DIGIT PUNCHED IN COLUMN FIMP0004
C  1 OF THE COMMAND CARD.  COLUMNS 2 AND 3 CONTAIN A UNIT NUMBER, AND   FIMP0005
C  COLUMNS 4-11 A SERIAL NUMBER.  (THE FIRST 4 COLUMNS OF THE SERIAL    FIMP0006
C  NUMBER ARE DEVOTED TO AN ALPHANUMERIC DECK IDENTIFIER AND THE LAST 4 FIMP0007
C  CONTAIN AN INTEGER CARD NUMBER.)  THE REMAINING COLUMNS OF THE       FIMP0008
C  COMMAND CARD ARE IGNORED.  COMMANDS ARE INITIALLY ASSUMED TO COME    FIMP0009
C  FROM UNIT 5.  THIS ASSIGNMENT CAN BE CHANGED BY ALTERING THE INITIAL FIMP0010
C  VALUE OF JCTL.                                                       FIMP0011
