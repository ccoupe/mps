Directory "stage2" is the text from Appendix A, and directory "wisp" is the
text from Appendices B and C.  This text is unchanged, except that it has
been split up into separate files.

Directory "Cstage2" contains an implementation of Stage2 based upon C
instead of FORTRAN.  An executable version of this implementation can be
built under Unix via make as described in file "Cstage2/README".
